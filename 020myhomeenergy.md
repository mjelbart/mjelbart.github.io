<p> “My Home Energy” is a virtual flat where you can discover energy efficiency improvement points and move toward a more sustainable home. Moving between three locations you can see where it's possible to save energy and what is most impactful (in Finland it's choosing a lower room temperature). Through VR we believe that we can reveal what is real and empower people to discuss and act upon energy consumption saving opportunities. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.hel.fi/uutiset/fi/kaupunkiymparisto/energiaviisaat-kaupungit-091019?pd=v">In collaboration with the City of Helsinki</a> we used the experience to discuss energy usage with students and to enable them to customise a VR experience using code.</p>
