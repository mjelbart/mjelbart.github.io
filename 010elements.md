<p>Photogrammetry is about collecting data using photos but here I use it just to refer to creating 3D models from photos. I created the models below using <a href="https://github.com/alicevision/meshroom">Meshroom</a> and <a href="https://blender.org">Blender</a>. Since 2020, devices with LIDAR like the <a href="https://varjo.com/products/xr-3/">Varjo XR-3</a>, iPhone 12 Pro and iPad Pro 2020 make it much easier to create 3D models from real life objects.</p>

		<h3>SRU Costume by Urs Dierker</h3>
		<p>We created a photogrammetric model of the costume and presented it in AR for advertising for the Helsinki Design Week exhibition and to make it more accessible during the COVID-19 lockdown. <a href="https://naturallydramatic-bicmat-aaltouniversity.glitch.me/">View on Glitch.com</a></p>
