“My Home Energy” is a virtual flat where you can discover energy efficiency improvement points and move toward a more sustainable home. Moving between three locations you can see where it's possible to save energy and what is most impactful (in Finland it's choosing a lower room temperature). Through VR we believe that we can reveal what is real and empower people to discuss and act upon energy consumption saving opportunities.
